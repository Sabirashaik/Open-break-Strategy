CODE UNDERSTANDING
a. Purpose of Code Sections:
•	The code begins by importing the Pandas library to handle data and reads a CSV file named 'BANKNIFTY.csv' without a header.
•	It preprocesses the data by dropping the last column and renaming the columns for better readability.
•	Utilizes variables like buy_price, sell_price, stoploss, position, tradetaken, tradeprice, profit, and loss for trading analysis.
•	Iterates through the data rows to analyze stock trading within specified time frames.
b. Buy and Sell Conditions:
•	Buys and sells stocks based on specific time conditions (between 09:15 and 15:30) using high and low prices.
•	Determines buy and sell actions at particular intervals (09:15, 09:30, 15:15) based on price fluctuations within these time frames.


Analysis:
a. Trading Logic:
•	Defines logic for initiating trades when certain conditions (price fluctuations within specified times) are met.
•	Closes positions based on stop loss or predetermined time conditions.
b. Profit/Loss Calculation:
•	Calculates profit and loss based on trade outcomes, considering different scenarios (price movements).
•	Implements a stop loss mechanism to limit losses during trades.
1.Profit Scenario:
•	Buy Trade Profit: If a stock is bought at a lower price and sold at a higher price, it results in a profit.
•	Sell Trade Profit: Selling a stock at a higher price and buying it back at a lower price (short selling) leads to profit.
2.Loss Scenario:
•	Buy Trade Loss: If a stock is bought at a higher price and sold at a lower price, it results in a loss.
•	Sell Trade Loss: Selling a stock at a lower price and buying it back at a higher price (short selling) leads to a loss.
3.Stop Loss Trigger:
If the price movement triggers the stop loss condition (i.e., the price hits the stop loss threshold), it results in a potential loss to limit further downside risk. The amount of loss depends on the difference between the trade price and the price at which the stop loss triggers.
4.Trade Close at Specific Time:
If the trade remains open until a specific time (e.g., 3:15 pm) and does not hit the stop loss, the profit or loss is calculated based on the difference between the trade price and the closing price at that time.




CONCLUSION:

The code's primary objective revolves around analyzing stock trading data within predetermined timeframes, employing a predefined trading strategy.
Identified potential limitations in the strategy necessitate further refinement for robust and comprehensive trading analysis.
